week 3 notes

podcast:

    "recording the stones takes a long time" --> yes
    this week --> 3d models of stones
    
    Bill Caraher:
        -he works in Cyprus
        -writing a book on NA archaerology (including atari cartridges lol)
        -big computer guy --> thinks a lot about digital workflows
        -all about digital tools for archaeology
        -theres too much going on now in digital archaeology that it cannot be considered one single thing
        -digital tools are forcing us to ask new ethical questions --> this observation reminds me of Zizek on bioethics
            --ownership and digital copies?
            --the digital and colonial relationships?
            --do I have to keep a record of all my emails?
            --is open access good? does it reinforce cultural elite standards?
            --private profit and public good --> corporations behind everyday technology? leveraging of efficiency for profit?
        -theres a lot of fetishization of big names in tech innovation (like elon), but theres so much development happening through the work of everyday people, often propping up those big names
        -digital archaeology is bringing up lots of questions about lots of standard things that havent been questioned in a long time (writing in notebooks, drawing pictures)
        
Negotiating memory: funerary commemoration associal change in emancipation-era Barbados

    how does situating stones in broader historical contexts bring new understandings to light?
    how does this article relate to the other article on the same research from last week?
    As critical players in the creation and negotiation of identity, community, and power,monuments were actively used, rewritten, created and destroyed–and this active process of social change persisted during the period of abolition and emancipation thatredefined Barbadian religious communities in the nineteenth century. 
    This research argues that by tracing changing spectrums of invisibility and visi-bility, anomalies, and the micro- and macro-scalar contexts of commemoration, it is possibleto decolonize cemetery studies and contribute new histories of struggle, resilience, andtransformation of communities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
    Picturing Barbados as that‘vast burial ground’(Handler1999, 13) owes a great deal to theBritish-Barbadian tradition of barring the majority of the population, enslaved Africans andAfrican-descendants, from Anglican churches, and therefore excluding the dead from theprimary British burial grounds. 
    The majority of these deaths would have been fol-lowed by interment on slave burial grounds, generally located close to slave villages onplantations.
    "being once a Christian, he could no more account him a Slave, and so lose the hold they had ofthem as Slaves, by making them Christians; and by that means should open such a gap, as allthe Planters in the Island would curse him." - quote from Lignon
    Baptism of enslaved and freed3people became more common in Barbados in the earlynineteenth century; nevertheless, relatively few African-Barbadians were buried in theburial grounds attached to Anglican churches or chapels. 
    Given the poverty, instability, and persecution that most enslaved and‘freed’individ-uals faced during this period, it is unsurprising that few commemorative monumentscan be confidently associated with them. 
    The first monuments erected to commemor-ate black individuals in traditionally white contexts would not have gone unnoticed inthe relatively small congregations of pre-emancipation Barbados; these stones cannot,therefore, be understood separate from the statement they would have made andtheir long-term legacies for the ways in which Barbadian race relations developed. Afocus on African-Barbadian families actively using monuments in Anglican churchyardsto negotiate their identity and place within colonial society highlights the potential fornew application of commemorative and memory studies in the Caribbean, and thisperiod of history more broadly.
    Commemorative practices, which not only reflect but were used strategically to con-struct and negotiate identities, relationships, and experiences in the colonial era,provide the opportunity to explore the ways in which people in Barbados reactedand contributed to transformations in social structures, race, and mobility, particularlyin the period following emancipation.
