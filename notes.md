    Bill Caraher:
        -he works in Cyprus
        -writing a book on NA archaerology (including atari cartridges lol)
        -big computer guy --> thinks a lot about digital workflows
        -all about digital tools for archaeology
        -theres too much going on now in digital archaeology that it cannot be considered one single thing
        -digital tools are forcing us to ask new ethical questions --> this observation reminds me of Zizek on bioethics
            --ownership and digital copies?
            --the digital and colonial relationships?
            --do I have to keep a record of all my emails?
            --is open access good? does it reinforce cultural elite standards?
            --private profit and public good --> corporations behind everyday technology? leveraging of efficiency for profit?
        -theres a lot of fetishization of big names in tech innovation (like elon), but theres so much development happening through the work of everyday people, often propping up those big names
        -digital archaeology is bringing up lots of questions about lots of standard things that havent been questioned in a long time (writing in notebooks, drawing pictures)
