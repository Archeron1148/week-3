week 3 notes

my model is in github and here https://p3d.in/gRxqZ --> when I upload it has no colour (missing texture?), I cant figure out how to fix that
I used the moodie plaque stone outside of the cemetery because I thought it would be important to preserve as it tells a story about the whole family and it might be otherwise ignored

podcast:

    "recording the stones takes a long time" --> yes
    this week --> 3d models of stones
    
    Bill Caraher:
        -he works in Cyprus
        -writing a book on NA archaerology (including atari cartridges lol)
        -big computer guy --> thinks a lot about digital workflows
        -all about digital tools for archaeology
        -theres too much going on now in digital archaeology that it cannot be considered one single thing
        -digital tools are forcing us to ask new ethical questions --> this observation reminds me of Zizek on bioethics
            --ownership and digital copies?
            --the digital and colonial relationships?
            --do I have to keep a record of all my emails?
            --is open access good? does it reinforce cultural elite standards?
            --private profit and public good --> corporations behind everyday technology? leveraging of efficiency for profit?
        -theres a lot of fetishization of big names in tech innovation (like elon), but theres so much development happening through the work of everyday people, often propping up those big names
        -digital archaeology is bringing up lots of questions about lots of standard things that havent been questioned in a long time (writing in notebooks, drawing pictures)
        
Negotiating memory: funerary commemoration associal change in emancipation-era Barbados
https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/cook2018.pdf

    how does situating stones in broader historical contexts bring new understandings to light?
    how does this article relate to the other article on the same research from last week?
    As critical players in the creation and negotiation of identity, community, and power,monuments were actively used, rewritten, created and destroyed–and this active process of social change persisted during the period of abolition and emancipation thatredefined Barbadian religious communities in the nineteenth century. 
    This research argues that by tracing changing spectrums of invisibility and visi-bility, anomalies, and the micro- and macro-scalar contexts of commemoration, it is possibleto decolonize cemetery studies and contribute new histories of struggle, resilience, andtransformation of communities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
    Picturing Barbados as that‘vast burial ground’(Handler1999, 13) owes a great deal to theBritish-Barbadian tradition of barring the majority of the population, enslaved Africans andAfrican-descendants, from Anglican churches, and therefore excluding the dead from theprimary British burial grounds. 
    The majority of these deaths would have been fol-lowed by interment on slave burial grounds, generally located close to slave villages onplantations.
    "being once a Christian, he could no more account him a Slave, and so lose the hold they had ofthem as Slaves, by making them Christians; and by that means should open such a gap, as allthe Planters in the Island would curse him." - quote from Lignon
    Baptism of enslaved and freed3people became more common in Barbados in the earlynineteenth century; nevertheless, relatively few African-Barbadians were buried in theburial grounds attached to Anglican churches or chapels. 
    Given the poverty, instability, and persecution that most enslaved and‘freed’individ-uals faced during this period, it is unsurprising that few commemorative monumentscan be confidently associated with them. 
    The first monuments erected to commemor-ate black individuals in traditionally white contexts would not have gone unnoticed inthe relatively small congregations of pre-emancipation Barbados; these stones cannot,therefore, be understood separate from the statement they would have made andtheir long-term legacies for the ways in which Barbadian race relations developed. Afocus on African-Barbadian families actively using monuments in Anglican churchyardsto negotiate their identity and place within colonial society highlights the potential fornew application of commemorative and memory studies in the Caribbean, and thisperiod of history more broadly.
    Commemorative practices, which not only reflect but were used strategically to con-struct and negotiate identities, relationships, and experiences in the colonial era,provide the opportunity to explore the ways in which people in Barbados reactedand contributed to transformations in social structures, race, and mobility, particularlyin the period following emancipation. 
     The temporal breadth of this study, from themiddle of the seventeenth century through to the middle of the twentieth century wascritical to framing the cultural context in which African-Barbadians began commemoratingtheir dead in Anglican churchyards before emancipation, and the ways in which traditionswere transformed after emancipation as black communities fought for and achievedgreater rights, freedoms, and equalities.
     Despite the limited number of black monuments during this period, commemorationalmost exclusively represents free women and/or their children, possibly underlining the role of relationships with white males (as companions and fathers of children) in acces-sing this type of material culture and convincing originally reluctant church leaders forapproval. 
     Christianity and the Anglican Church, previously a marker of‘whiteness’(Twine and Gal-lagher2014), were also transformed by emancipation. 
     During and following emancipation, Christian teaching was deemed critical topreparing the African-Barbadian population to be freed persons in a British colony, particu-larly by instilling morality as well as skills like basic literacy. Parish church populations andbaptism rates increased drastically (Figure 3). 
     Conversion also often created opportunities togain positions of power and respect within the community through participation, network-ing, and occasionally employment as wardens, maintenance workers, and administration.While parts of Christianity were adopted, where deemed useful, less appealing aspectsthat clashed with existing cultural practices were often resisted, including family structuresand views of polygamy and illegitimacy, and the Sabbath (and the resulting ban on Sundaymarkets and dances). Moreover, relative to many Caribbean and American contexts, the Bar-badian Anglican church remained largely unchanged by African culture post-emancipation,due to a history of intensive planter control of religion, the Anglican church, and the regu-lation of slavery (Erskine2014, 153).
     The global, revolutionary social, economic, and political changes in the twentieth centuryare, in many ways an extension or continuation of previous memory practices and traditionsthat are rarely included in archaeologies and histories of cemeteries. 
     the transformations of infrastructure, political structures,and economy in Barbados accompanying independence from the British Empire had dra-matic implications for the experiences of every social group on the island. 
     Later in the twentieth century, as the economy shifted from its traditionalreliance on sugar to tourism, monuments were further re-written and modified throughnew commemoration of the long dead to create historical narratives that would be of interestto visitors. 
    After nearly 200 years of segregated burial of British- andAfrican-Barbadian communities, the push towards abolishing the slave trade, and thenthe institution of slavery altogether, increased the rates of religious conversion and edu-cation for African-Barbadians, redefining memory practices and uses of material culturein commemorating the dead. The impact of black monuments in previously exclusivelywhite landscapes, the ways in which black families established and solidified traditionsthroughout the nineteenth century, and the modification of those material records intwentieth and twenty-first century heritage practice are critical to understandingmemory, tradition, and social identity in Barbadian history.
    This archaeological case study of colonial Barbados, and the islanders’relationships to religion, race and power, moves away from emphasizing plantationslave cemeteries in African-Barbadian funerary practice to recognize alternative contextsthat were critical to the processes through which memories, social structures, and land-scapes were constructed and resisted. 
    Reflecting on scholarship, the results of this research challenge our preconceivednotions of the contexts and methodologies that will decolonize Atlantic studies by recog-nizing and addressing more diverse and complex voices, narratives, and experiences.
